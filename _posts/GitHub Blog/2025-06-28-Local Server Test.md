# real-time test.

Are you okay?

- -> not okay:  
need to make a "md file" in  
"yyyy-mm-dd-title.md"  
format!!  
 to be applied properly in real-time base.

- Need to open "local server"
bundle exec jekyll serveÂ (at your GitHub Blog directory!!!)

- Normally,  
http://127.0.0.1:4000  (or localhost:4000)
is your local server address
